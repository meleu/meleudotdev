- üêß Linux nerd since the late 90s

- üêö I love the shell (mainly bash) and the Command Line Interface. I write a blog (**in portuguese**) totally focused on the terminal environment: <https://meleu.sh>

- Ô∏èüëæ Big retrograming fan. Between 2016-2021 I dedicated a big portion of my time to open source projects related to this hobby (mainly [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org)).

- üìö Avid book reader. Maybe you can know more about me seeing the list of [[books]] I read.


## meleu in 2 minutes

I'm a Linux user since 1999 (which is when I started to work and bought my first computer). At that time I became fascinated by the Unix philosophy (do one thing and do it well) and the hacker culture (share knowledge above all things).

I spent a big portion of my youth having fun with Linux, shell scripting, C programming, studying network protocols, and sharing knowledge with other nerds on IRC. In the early 2000s I produced some texts (in portuguese), one deep diving the¬†[Unix File Permissions](http://meleu.github.io/txts/permissoes.txt)¬†and another one about¬†[bash Programming](https://meleu.gitbooks.io/bashscripting/content/)

In 2004 I started working in the oil industry, as a Control Room Operator of an Oil Rig (where I stayed for 17 years). Yeah, it wasn't a job in the IT field, but for a lad in his early 20s, that was an exciting one.

In 2011 I graduated in Computer Science (while still working) and thought the natural path would be to work with IT, but the¬†~~money~~¬†fate made me stay in the same job.

During the years spent in the oil industry, besides acquiring good technical knowledge and systemic view of industrial processes, I was also able to develop my social and communication skills, working and managing people with different backgrounds.

In 2016 I started to get involved with open source projects related to my hobby: retrogaming. I started with [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) (using a lot of bash scripting, and parsing XML files), made some contributions to [RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) (using the C language), and then I became focused in the [RetroAchievements](https://github.com/RetroAchievements) project (using a myriad of web technologies like HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, NodeJS, PHP, git, bash, etc.).

In RetroAchievements, as part of the project's leadership, I became some sort of a community manager, where I used a lot of the, so called, *soft skills*. I also produced a lot of [documentation](https://docs.retroachievements.org/)¬†for the project.

Since 2018, I started to manage Linux servers for a few customers/friends and also launched the <https://meleu.sh/> website, sharing my knowledge about shell scripting (in Portuguese).

In 2021 I finally left the oil industry. I started my career as DevOps Engineer, mainly handling CI/CD pipelines and deploying containerized applications with Kubernetes. During that time I realized how beneficial it was for me to have a broad experience with industrial processes. It's a highly valuable knowledge to have in the DevOps world.

### RetroAchievements

**NOTE**: I'm **not** the creator of this project.

- website: <https://retroachievements.org>

What I did:

- contributed with the implementation of the RetroAchievements feature in the RetroArch (basically building/testing implementation in various architectures while coding was mostly done by [Leiradel](https://github.com/leiradel)).
- contributed with code for the [backend](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb).
- server maintenance (Linux/NginX).
- created the [documentation project](https://docs.retroachievements.org/).
- community management


### RADocs

- website: <https://docs.retroachievements.org>

Documentation for the RetroAchievements project.

I created this project using the following technologies:

- [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs/wiki/), as the place where contributors can create/update contents for the website.
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for converting the markdown files from the wiki into the website's pages.
- [Some scripts](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs) I created to glue things together.


### RANews

- website: <https://news.retroachievements.org>

A monthly web-zine, bringing news about the RetroAchievements scene.

I designed the website from scratch (that was my first website built from scratch).

Technologies used

- HTML/CSS only (I opted to not use JavaScript).
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), as the Static Site Generator.


### RABot

A Discord bot for the RetroAchievements community.

- [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org/#/)
- A bunch 3rd party APIs.


## Interviews & Podcasts

Because I put a lot of effort into the [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org) project, I was interviewed on some podcasts to talk about myself and the project.
