I'm a Linux user since 1999 (which is when I started to work and bought my first computer). At that time I became fascinated by the Unix philosophy (do one thing and do it well) and the hacker culture (share knowledge above all things).

I spent a big portion of my youth having fun with Linux, shell scripting, C programming, studying network protocols, and sharing knowledge with other nerds on IRC. In the early 2000s I produced some texts (in portuguese), one deep diving the [Unix File Permissions](http://meleu.github.io/txts/permissoes.txt) and another one about [bash Programming](https://meleu.gitbooks.io/bashscripting/content/)

In 2004 I started working in the oil industry, as a Control Room Operator of an Oil Rig (where I stayed for 17 years). Yeah, it wasn't a job in the IT field, but for a lad in his early 20s, that was an exciting one.

In 2011 I graduated in Computer Science (while still working) and thought the natural path would be to work with IT, but the ~~money~~ fate made me stay in the same job.

During the years spent in the oil industry, besides acquiring good technical knowledge and systemic view of industrial processes, I was also able to develop my social and communication skills, working and managing people with different backgrounds.

In 2016 I started to get involved with open source projects related to my hobby: retrogaming. I started with [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) (using a lot of bash scripting, and parsing XML files), made some contributions to [RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) (using the C language), and then I became focused in the [RetroAchievements](https://github.com/RetroAchievements) project (using a myriad of web technologies like HTML/CSS/JavaScript, SQL, NodeJS, PHP, git, bash, etc.).

In RetroAchievements, as part of the project's leadership, I became some sort of a community manager, where I used a lot of the, so called, *soft skills*. I also produced a lot of [documentation](https://docs.retroachievements.org/) for the project.

Since 2018, I started to manage Linux servers for a few customers/friends and also launched the <https://meleu.sh/> website, sharing my knowledge about shell scripting (in Portuguese).

In 2021 I finally left the oil industry. I started my career as DevOps Engineer, mainly handling CI/CD pipelines and deploying containerized applications with Kubernetes. During that time I realized how beneficial it was for me to have a broad experience with industrial processes. It's a highly valuable knowledge to have in the DevOps world.
