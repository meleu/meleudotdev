# Hi! 👋 I'm meleu

## Short version

- 🐧 I'm a Linux nerd since the late 90s

- 🧑‍💻 currently working as a DevOps Specialist, dealing with things like
    - bash (a lot of bash)
    - GCP
    - GitLab CI
    - Docker
    - Kubernetes
    - ArgoCD
    - NodeJS
    - and a bunch of other nerdy things

- 🐚 I love the shell (mainly bash) and I try to apply Clean Code concepts on my scripts.

- 🤓 I write a blog (**in portuguese**) totally focused on the terminal environment: <https://meleu.sh>

- 🕹️ I love [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org/) 👾

- 📚 Maybe you can know more about me seeing the list of [[books]] I read.


## Long version

To be done...
