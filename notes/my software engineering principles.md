## Underpromise and overdeliver

> Commit to fewer things, and deliver (or overdeliver) on these very few ones.
> 
> This is how you stand out - not by doing many things never better than average.

For the "commit to fewer things", I think I had a good help from these books: [[Essencialismo]]
and [[Os 7 HÃ¡bitos das pessoas Altamente Eficazes]].


## Be an owner, not a renter

> Don't complain: fix.
> 
> Dont ignore broken windows: mend them.
> 
> When it's really not you who can fix this, find the person that can.
> 
> Do you wonder what the best way to advance your career is? It's this approach.

Not sure if there's a book "teaching" this. But my mind works like this: wherever I invest my time, I want to see it progress, evolve, succeed...

I remember how I managed to articulate it that way. I was reading *The Career Advice I Wish I Had*, from Ali Spittel.
<https://welearncode.com/career-advice/>
And she mentions: "Find employers who want you to succeed".

While reading that I realized that it's also useful to invert that logic: "Find employers you want to see succeed".

At least in my case, this is the mindset that makes me embrace the ownership proposed by Gergely.
