# Swimming analogy - when something is hard in the beginning

I saw this analogy in the <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>, and I liked it.

Learning something that is useful but hard in the beginning is like swimming. When you don't know how to swim, it's not fun at all. But when you learn how to swim, that's one of the best things to do in a hot day!

I think it's a similar feeling I have about using [[vim]]
