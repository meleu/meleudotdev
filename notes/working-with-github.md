## Try open-source

My path:

- started writing documentation
- then reporting bugs
- then making small contributions
- then making bigger contributions
- then creating projects from scratch

The main takeaway: mentoring from experienced people


## Things to do if you're out of ideas

- Watch the [Testing in Rails lecture](https://kitt.lewagon.com/knowledge/tutorials/rails_testing) and apply what you learned in your final project or the AirBnB clone
- Do [Backend-challenges](https://github.com/CollabCodeTech/backend-challenges)
- Do [Frontend-challenges](https://github.com/felipefialho/frontend-challenges)
- Choose a language on [exercism.org](https://exercism.org/), do the challenges and [document you're learning](https://github.com/meleu/exercism/tree/master/ruby)
- Convert book code samples examples to Ruby (or your favorite language)
