# Nix Learning Path

## 1. Getting Started with Nix:

- Start by installing Nix on your preferred platform (macOS or Linux). You can use the official Nix installer or nix-darwin for macOS.
- Familiarize yourself with the basic Nix commands like `nix-env`, `nix-shell`, and `nix-build`. These are essential for package management and environment setup.

### nix-env

The command nix-env is used to manipulate Nix user environments. User environments are sets of software  packages  available  to  a user at some point in time. In other words, they are a synthesised view of the programs available in the Nix store. There may be many user environments: different users can have  different  environments, and individual users can switch between different environments.

`nix-env`  takes exactly one operation flag which indicates the subcommand to be performed. 

### nix-shell

The  command nix-shell will build the dependencies of the specified derivation, but not the derivation itself. It will then start an interactive shell in which all environment variables defined by the derivation path have been set to their corresponding values, and the script $stdenv/setup has been sourced. This is useful for  reproducing the environment of a derivation for development.

If path is not given, nix-shell defaults to shell.nix if it exists, and default.nix otherwise.

### nix-build

The nix-build command builds the derivations described by the Nix expressions in paths. If the build succeeds, it  places a symlink to the result in the current directory. The symlink is called result. If there are multiple Nix expressions, or the Nix expressions evaluate to multiple derivations, multiple  sequentially  numbered symlinks are created (result, result-2, and so on).

If no paths are specified, then nix-build will use default.nix in the current directory, if it exists.

If an element of paths starts with http:// or https://, it is interpreted as the URL of a tarball that will be downloaded  and  unpacked  to a temporary location. The tarball must include a single top-level directory containing at least a file named default.nix.

`nix-build` is essentially a wrapper around `nix-instantiate` (to translate a high-level Nix expression to a  low-level store derivation) and `nix-store --realise` (to build the store derivation).

### nix-channels

Channels  are a mechanism for referencing remote Nix expressions and conveniently retrieving their latest version.


## 2. Understanding Nix Language:

- Learn the basics of the Nix expression language. This is crucial for writing your custom Nix expressions, which define packages and configurations. [Nix Pills](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/) and the Nix manual are great resources for this.
- Another useful resource: <https://nixcloud.io/tour>


## 3. Nixpkgs and Flakes:

- Study the Nixpkgs repository, which contains thousands of package definitions for both Linux and macOS.
- Explore Flakes, which is a modern and convenient way to manage Nix projects and packages. It simplifies the creation and sharing of Nix configurations.
- Learn how to include packages from Nixpkgs into your user environment or Nix profiles using the nixpkgs.configurable.nix attribute.

## 4. Configuration Management:

- Understand how NixOS uses Nix to manage system configurations. While you may not be using NixOS itself, the principles are beneficial for managing user environments.
- Explore using Nix to declaratively define and manage user-level configurations, similar to what NixOS does for system-level configurations.

## 5. Home Manager:

- Home Manager (part of Nixpkgs) is a tool that simplifies the management of user environments and dotfiles. Learn how to configure your development environment using Home Manager.
- Create a Home Manager configuration that defines your preferred software, development tools, and dotfiles.

## 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility:

- Be aware of platform-specific differences when defining packages and configurations. Use conditionals to adapt your Nix expressions for different platforms.

## 7. Sharing Your Configurations:

- Consider using GitHub or a similar platform to host and version control your Nix configurations.
- Share your configurations with others, and learn from existing Nix configurations in the Nixpkgs and Home Manager repositories.

## 8. Practical Usage and Troubleshooting:

- Practice using Nix to install and manage packages. Experiment with creating Nix expressions for software that you use regularly.
- Learn how to troubleshoot common issues and errors in Nix expressions.

## 9. Automation and Scripting:

- Explore ways to automate the setup of your development environment using Nix. You can write scripts to set up your environment quickly on a new machine.

## 10. Community and Resources:

- Engage with the Nix community through forums, mailing lists, and IRC channels. It's a valuable resource for getting help and sharing your knowledge.
- Stay updated on Nix-related news, as the ecosystem is continuously evolving.
