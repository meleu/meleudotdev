# Onboarding issues in large-scale open source projects

Interesting ideas/suggestions about how to make things easier for new contributors.

- [part 1](http://ellenkorbes.com/onboarding_issues_pt1/)
- [part 2](http://ellenkorbes.com/onboarding_issues_pt2/)
- [part 3](http://ellenkorbes.com/onboarding_issues_pt3/)
- interesting talk: <https://youtu.be/A28t8vCt9Wg>

The part #1 is more targeted at large and widely used projects (it mentions people getting paid to work on it).

The part #2 has a lot of invaluable advices. The part that gave me good insights was the part about mentoring and scaling and making a better use of the mentor's time.
