# Pop! OS

## Things I'm missing

- snap window to the right-side of the screen with `Super-right_arrow` (same for the left)
- what's the shortcut to change the workspace?


## Useful trick
```bash
# dump current configs
dconf dump / > dconf-settings.ini

# load configs from file
dconf load / < dconf-settings.ini
```
