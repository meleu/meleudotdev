# typing

I enjoy typing faster, and this website is a very cool one for practicing: <https://monkeytype.com/>

And these one are good for practicing code typing:

- <https://www.speedtyper.dev/>
- <https://coderush.xyz/>
- There's also a VSCode plugin called "Warm Up - Typing Test" by Jeusto, seems to be better then a web-based application
