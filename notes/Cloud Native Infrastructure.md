# Cloud Native Infrastructure

While studying for the [[GCP Cloud Developer]] certification I detected some knowledge gaps that made me want to go for a more "conceptual" content. This book is helping to fill such gaps: [[Cloud Native Infrastructure: Patterns for Scalable and Applications in a Dynamic Environment]].

Maybe off-topic, but I'm going to put this note here... this book looks cool: [Network Programmability and Automation: Skills for the Next-Generation Network Engineer](https://a.co/d/0mwni3X)
