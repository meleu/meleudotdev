### The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock

The title makes me believe it's about a couple...

It's not explictly said, but in my mind I see a man and a woman.

> Let us go then, you and I,
> When the evening is spread out against the sky
> **Like a patient etherized upon a table;**

OK, here's the first verse that I could understand, but I'm failing to make the connection. Or seeing the author wants to say figuratively.


> Let us go through certain half-deserted streets,
> The muttering retreats
> Of restless nights in one-nigh cheat hotels
> And sawdust restaurante with oyster-shells:
> Streets that follow like a tedious argument
> Of insidious intent


> To lead you to an overwhelming question...
> Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"
> Let us go and make our visit.




>
> In the room the women come and go
> Talking of Michelangelo.
>
