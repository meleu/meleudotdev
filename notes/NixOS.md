The promise to "**have reproducible, declarative and reliable systems**" is making me excited after suffering with MacOS peculiarities.

Example of things that made me annoyed in MacOS:

- `bash` is really old (3.2)
- `sed` is not compatible with GNU sed
- `mktemp` is not compatible with what I have in debian/alpine based distros
