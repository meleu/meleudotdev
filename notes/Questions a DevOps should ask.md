# Questions a DevOps should ask

### technical
- How long would it take to deploy a change that involves just one single line of code?
    - Do you do this in a repeatable, reliable basis?


### cultural

- If somebody thinks of a good idea, how do we deliver it to users as quickly as possible?
- How do we enable developers, testers, build and operations personnel to work together effectively?
