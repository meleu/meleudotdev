# Vim Tip 53 - delete around or change inside

[[Practical Vim]]

In short:

- For `d`eletion, use `a`round.
- For `c`hanges, use `i`nside.

Reasoning:

When you want to delete, you usually want to also delete the trailing spaces.

When you want to change, you usually want to keep the trailing spaces.
