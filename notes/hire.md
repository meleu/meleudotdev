## Personal/side projects I've built from scratch

#### LogBots

In 2018 I created a follow-up system for a local logistics company.

In the website, developed with PHP, the user uploads an Excel spreadsheet with the shipments' info, the data is parsed and persisted in a MySQL database.

I also created an API (PHP) and a telegram bot (JavaScript/NodeJS) to interact with it. The truck drivers use the telegram bot to update the status of their deliveries.

This system is still in use today.

**Technologies:**

- LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- HTML/CSS/JS
- DigitalOcean (Cloud Provider)
- JavaScript/NodeJS (telegram bot)
- REST API

#### RADocs

Created tools that converts a github wiki into a beautiful documentation webpage.

- Repository: <https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs>
- Wiki: <https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs/wiki/>
- Website: <https://docs.retroachievements.org/>

**Technologies:**

- mkdocs
- Shell Scripting (bash)
- GitHub Actions


#### RABot

The RetroAchievements Discord Bot, consuming a lot of 3rd party APIs.

- Repository: <https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RABot>
- Discord Server where it runs: <https://discord.gg/dq2E4hE>

**Technologies:**

- JavaScript/NodeJS
- DiscordJS module
- consuming a bunch of 3rd party REST APIs

#### RANews

RetroAchievements digital magazine. I've built this to learn more about CSS.

- Website: <https://news.retroachievements.org/>

**Technologies:**

- HTML/CSS
- Jekyll as the Static Site Generator
