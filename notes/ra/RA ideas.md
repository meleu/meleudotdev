# RA ideas

Things I'd like to see in the RetroAchievements scene:

- An option to update the unlock timestamp so people can join events without creating new accounts or having to reset their progress.
- The concept of "maintainers" for achievement sets
- The possibility to create "custom leaderboards"
    - 1st. only for friends
    - 2nd. for specific events
- Have offline cheevos so we can play with achievements in a gadget like the Miyoo Mini (which runs RetroArch but doesn't have wifi)


### offline cheevos

Steps:

- how RetroArch identify ROMs? (to download their assets, for example)
- how to link ROMs and offline cheevos?
