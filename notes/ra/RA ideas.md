# RA ideas

Things I'd like to see in the RetroAchievements scene.


## RAWeb

- Clone RAWeb repo and `docker compose up` is enough to have a local instance
    - use alpine-based images in the `docker-compose.yml`
- An option to update the unlock timestamp so people can join events without creating new accounts or having to reset their progress.
- The concept of "maintainers" for achievement sets
- The possibility to create "custom rankings"
    - 1st. only for friends
    - 2nd. for specific events


## RetroArch
- Have offline cheevos so we can play with achievements in a gadget like the Miyoo Mini (which runs RetroArch but doesn't have wifi)


### offline cheevos

Questions to be answered:

- how RetroArch identify ROMs? (to download their assets, for example)
- how to link ROMs and offline cheevos?
