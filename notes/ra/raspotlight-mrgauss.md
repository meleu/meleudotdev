# RASpotlight - MrGauss

In the beginning of the last month I was on a vacation trip with my family, visting the beautiful city of Recife in the Northeast of Brazil. Turns out that Recife is also the home of a very kind person I met here in the RetroAchievements scene and who I was fortunate enough to meet in person:

We chatted about several things and, of course, about RetroAchievements. During our conversation I couldn't help but notice how the feeling of belonging to a community of people who share the same passion, has a positive impact on a person's life.

I became interested in putting **MrGauss** in the RASpotlight and here we are.

I hope you enjoy the reading!

Let's start with your background as a (retro)gamer. How when did you start your gamer life? Which console and what were your first favorite games?

#### MrGauss

Oh, that's a good one! Haha.

When I was a kid, my father had an Atari 2600 and he let me play it on the weekends. Later, I went to visit my aunt and my cousin was playing a Mega Drive (that's the Genesis) in his room, it was running Sonic 2. I fell in love with it and couldn't remove it from my toughts.

My family gave me one as a present on the next Christmas and that was my very first console. Sonic 2 and Earthworm Jim were my first favorite games on that console.

As someone who also started the gamer life with an Atari 2600, I can imagine the shock of seeing the Mega Drive graphics while being used to the Atari. LOL.

What other consoles you had after the Mega Drive?

#### MrGauss

I've always been a console gamer. On the retro side of things, I've got the SNES some years after the Genesis, then came the Nintendo 64, Playstation, Game Boy Advance, Gamecube and Playstation 2.

I never did get a Dreamcast, haha. It was very expensive here in Brazil and it was practicaly impossible for a teenager to get one. The DC was a console I really wanted to have back then but couldn't.

How did you know about the RetroAchievements website?

What was your first impressions?

#### MrGauss

I don't remember where I first read about RA. I think it was in a brazilian forum about videogames called Outerspace, but I'm not sure. When I first got my Raspberry Pi, I studied every menu looking for possible improvements and I saw an option to auto login on Retroachievments.

Some time later, I was diagnosed with a herniated disc, it was a very difficult time and I had to lay flat for nearly 2 months. With not much to do, I decided to give RA a go. So I made my profile on the site and bang... there I was. RA helped me a lot at the time and I'll always be grateful for it. It made that difficult time a lot easier.

I was simply amazed about everything. I mean... it's really amazing when you think about it. At the time, I had absolutely no idea about how it worked, who were the devs behind everything and all the fuss happening on the background, in the Discord server.

What a coincidence. I also came to the RetroAchievements from the RetroPie scene.

Although I knew the website from a friend, I wasn't that interested because at that time (2016) it was limited to Windows emulators only. As a Linux nerd it didn't sparked my interest. Thanks to the the amazing job of [leiradel](https://youtu.be/1P-l0Dq5-Uo) on the RetroArch front, we started to have achievements on so many non-Windows devices.

At that time I was really active on the RetroPie scene, and as "The Cheevos Guy" there, I was keeping [their cheevos-related documentation](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/RetroAchievements/) uptodate. So, if you managed to have achievements on your RetroPie, I guess I can consider I did a good job. ðŸ˜‡

I'm also glad to know that you recovered from your health issues and that RetroAchievements could ease such difficult period of time.

Now, talk a little about your first experiences interacting with the community. How did you realized that it's not a static project, but a living community?

What made you become interested in creating achievements?

#### meleu

Did you know these computer's topics before being interested in achievement creation? Were you familiar with concepts like bit, byte, hexadecimal, little endian, etc.?

If not, tell us about your experience filling these gaps.

Putting aside these nerdy things, let's talk a bit about humans.

While I was an active admin of this project I often saw people saying nice things about you. What specially caught my attention were what people said about how thoughtful you were when doing a code review for Jr. Developers.

Please tell us about your motivations. What makes you spend your time helping others to create achievements while you could be, for example, playing retrogames?
