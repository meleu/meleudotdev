## RetroArch

- Have offline cheevos so we can play with achievements in a gadget like the Miyoo Mini (which runs RetroArch but doesn't have wifi)


### offline cheevos

Questions to be answered:

- how RetroArch identify ROMs? (to download their assets, for example)
- how to link ROMs and offline cheevos?
- how to load json files from "disk"
