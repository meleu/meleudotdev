# Open Source projects I'm proud of


### RetroAchievements

**NOTE**: I'm **not** the creator of this project.

- website: <https://retroachievements.org>

What I did:

- contributed with the implementation of the RetroAchievements feature in the RetroArch (basically building/testing implementation in various architectures while coding was mostly done by [Leiradel](https://github.com/leiradel)).
- contributed with code for the [backend](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAWeb).
- server maintenance (Linux/NginX).
- created the [documentation project](https://docs.retroachievements.org/).

### RADocs

- website: <https://docs.retroachievements.org>

Documentation for the RetroAchievements project.

I created this project using the following technologies:

- [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs/wiki/), as the place where contributors can create/update contents for the website.
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) for converting the markdown files from the wiki into the website's pages.
- [Some scripts](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs) I created to glue things together.


### RANews

- website: <https://news.retroachievements.org>

A monthly web-zine, bringing news about the RetroAchievements scene.

I designed the website from scratch (that was my first website built from scratch).

Technologies used

- HTML/CSS only (I opted to not use JavaScript).
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), as the Static Site Generator.
