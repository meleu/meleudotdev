# aider.chat

<https://aider.chat/>

```bash
pip install aider-chat
```

Create a `~/.aider.conf.yml` (get the [template here](https://aider.chat/docs/config/aider_conf.html))
```yaml
anthropic-api-key: PUT-YOUR-KEY-HERE
sonnet: true
```

If you want to test aider without an existing project, create a dir so it can create the `.git` structure. If you want to use aider in an existing directory, just enter the directory and run `aider`.

> [!important]
> Don't ask the LLM to do to much at once!
> 
> The results are much better if you work iterately.
