# Practical Object-Oriented Design

#books/tech 

### Being a programmer
I've found in the first pages of this book the reason why I love to be a programmer.

From "Introduction"

> Those of us whose work is to write software are incredibly lucky. Building software is a **guiltless pleasure** because we get to use our creative energy to get things done. We have arranged our lives to have it both ways; we can enjoy the pure act of writing code in sure knowledge that the code we write has use.


From 1.1 "In Praise of Design":

> If painful programming were the most cost-effective way to produce working software, programmers would be morally obligated to suffer stoically or to find other jobs.
> 
> Fortunately, you do not have to choose between pleasure and productivity. The programming techniques that make code a joy to write overlap with those that most efficiently produce software.


### Easy to change 

> Applications that are easy to change are a pleasure to write and a joy to extend. They are flexible and adaptable. Applications that resist change are just the opposite; every change is expensive and each makes the next cost more.

Anticipating changes:

> Designs that anticipate specific future requirements almost always and badly. Practical design does not anticipate what will happen to your application; it merely accepts that something will and that, in the present, you cannot know what. It doesn't guess the future; it preserves your options for accommodating the future. It doesn't choose; it leaves you room to move.
>
> **The purpose of design is to allow you design later** and it's primary goal is to reduce the cost of change.


### Importance of design 

> successful and _undesigned_ applications carry the seeds of their own destruction.
