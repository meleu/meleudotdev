# 99 Bottles of OOP

## 1. Rediscovering Simplicity

> When you were new to programming you wrote simple code. (...) Since then, you've learned new skills, tackled harder problems, and produced increasingly complex solutions. Experience has taught you that most code will someday change, and you've begun to craft it in anticipation of that day. **Complexity seems both natural and inevitable**.
> 
> Where you once optimized code for *understandability*, you now focus on its *changeability*. Your code is less *concrete* but more *abstract* - you've made it initially harder to understand in hopes that it will ultimately be easier to maintain.
> 
> **This is the basic promise of Object-Oriented Design** (OOD): that if you're willing to accept increases in the complexity of your code along *some* dimensions, you'll be rewarded with decreases in complexity along *others*.  OOD doesn't claim to be free; it merely asserts that its benefits outweigh its costs.
