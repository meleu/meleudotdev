# Vim Tip 4, 5 and 6
[[Practical Vim]]

## Vim Tip 4


Not much to learn here...

The only new things are:

- it's possible to repeat the last `:s/pattern/replace/` command with `&`
- record a macro on `x`: `qx{changes}q`
    - execute it: `@x`

## Vim Tip 5 - search with asterisk

[[Practical Vim]]

In normal mode, the `*` command searches the word where the cursor is.

That was the useful thing from this tip.


## Vim Tip 6 - dot formula

The dot formula is when you managed to have a situation where you only need one keystroke to move the cursor to your next target and then one keystroke to repeat the last command.
