## Chapter 1 - Welcome to Software Construction

Activities that go into software development include:

- problem definition
- requirements development
- construction planning
- software architecture, or high-level design
- **detailed design**
- **coding and debugging**
- **unit testing**
- **integration testing**
- **integration**
- system testing


### Key Points

> - Software construction is the central activity in software development; construction is the only activity that's guaranteed to happen on every project.
> - The main activities in construction are:
>     - detailed design
>     - coding
>     - debugging
>     - integration
>     - testing (unit and integration)
> - In the final analysis, your understanding of how to do constructions determines how good a programmer you are.

Just like in building constructions, those who understand how to do it are good constructors.
