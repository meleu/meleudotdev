## Preface

I had an epiphany moment about "cost to fix vs cost of not fixing" and it made me remember the concept of [[cost of action vs. cost of inaction]], that I learned from Tim Ferris.

#### quotes

About the importance of software construction (aka "coding"):

> Software construction is the only activity that's guaranteed to be done. Requirements can be assumed rather than developed; architecture can be shortchanged rather than designed; and testing can be abbreviated or skipped rather than fully planned and executed. But if there's going to be a program, there has to be a construction, and that makes construction a uniquely fruitful area in which to improve development practices.

About "focusing on the principles":

> Some of the most beneficial programming aids are practices that you can use regardless of the environment or languages you're working in.
