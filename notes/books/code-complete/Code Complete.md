# Book Review: Code Complete

## Why did I read this book?

Many good reviews saying that experienced programmers benefit from the knowledge in this book.

After reading the first 7 chapters I realized that this book has a lot of "progammer's wisdom". I'm very sure that my time spent reading this book really worth it.
