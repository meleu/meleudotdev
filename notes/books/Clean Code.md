# Clean Code

#books/tech 

In the Chapter 1 I found an inspiring and powerful analogy for when I think about "how to encourage people to care about quality, despite business pressure":

> what if you were a doctor and had a patient who demanded that you stop all the silly hand-washing in preparation for surgery because it was taking too much time? Clearly the patient is the boss; and yet the doctor should absolutely refuse to comply. Why? Because the doctor knows more than the patient about the risks of disease and infection. It would be unprofessional (never mind criminal) for the doctor to comply with the patient.

It somehow made remember the [[Regra 02 - Cuide de si mesmo como cuidaria de alguÃ©m sob sua responsabilidade]], where Jordan Peterson says that we are more susceptible to external pressure (a doctor being unprofessional can be considered a crime) than internal motivation (a doctor just wanting to be "professional").

Summing up:

> They [managers] may defend the schedule and requrirements with passion; but that's their job. It's *your* job to defend the code with equal passion.
