# Crime and Punishment

An interesting thing is that I found some similarities with The Catcher in the Rye. Specially the fact that the main character is a depressive guy, disillusioned with life.

The main difference is that Crime and Punishment is heavier, and darker. Addressing more miserable situations, mainly the ones caused by poverty.

Another thing that caught my attention and that it's an idea that came to my mind maybe a couple of years ago. And it's about "using the good as an excuse to do the evil".
