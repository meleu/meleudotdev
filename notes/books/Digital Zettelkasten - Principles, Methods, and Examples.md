# Digital Zettelkasten - Principles, Methods, and Examples

It's a book from [Dave Kadavy](https://kadavy.net/).

A good idea of what the book is can be seen in [this article here](https://kadavy.net/blog/posts/zettelkasten-method-slip-box-digital-example/)

## main takeaway

The book is pretty shallow, but made me internalize the importance of atomic notes.


## Why did I read this book?

I want to improve my Personal Knowledge Management methodology.

This short book is just a tidbit about this topic. Quick reading, no huge value, but I don't consider the time spent as wasted.


## Notes


I like the flow chart of his Zettelkasten process:

The author says that it's inspired by the Getting Thing Done method ([[A Arte de fazer Acontecer]]).


## choosing keywords/tags

This is actually a quote taken from [[How to take smart notes]]):

> The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? **A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it?** It is a crucial difference.


## Comfortable rituals for managing your Zettelkasten

Ask yourself: **In what situations can I work on my Zettelkasten?**
