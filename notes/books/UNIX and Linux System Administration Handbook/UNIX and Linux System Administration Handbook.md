# UNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook

The version I have is the 5th edition.

Really really really useful book for anyone who wants to work with Linux, as a SysAdmin, a DevOps or anything like that...

The book presents the most important concepts of all things related to System Administration and then points good material for further reading.

In the links below there are some notes about things I learned in each chapter.
