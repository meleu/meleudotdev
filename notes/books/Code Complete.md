# Book Review: Code Complete

## Why did I read this book?

Many good reviews saying that experienced programmers benefit from the knowledge in this book.


## Favorite quotes

### Chapter 1 - Welcome to **Software Construction**

> Software construction is the central acitivity in software development; construction is the only activity that's guaranteed to happen on every project.

This book uses the term "software constructions" to refer to "coding".

> In the final analysis, your understanding of how to do constructions determines how good a programmer you are.

Just like in building constructions, those who understand how to do it are good constructors.


### Chapter 2 - Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Development

Metaphors are heuristics, not algorithms. Therefore they are not mutually exclusive (you can use more than one metaphor to better understand software).

#### Algorithm vs. Heuristic

^f43b96

 > An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions for carrying out a particular task. (...) A heuristic is a technique that helps you look for an answer.
 > (...) An algorithm gives you the instructions directly. A heuristic tells you how to discover the instructions for yourself, or at least where to look for them.
> (...) Here is an algorithm for driving to someone's house: Take Highway 167 south to Puyallup. Take the South Hill Mall exit and drive 4.5 miles up the hill. Turn right at the light by the grocery store, and then take the first left. Turn into the driveway of the large tan house on the left, at 714 North Cedar.
> Here's a heuristic for getting to someone's house: Find the last letter we mailed you. Drive to the town in the return address. When you get to town, ask someone where our house is. Everyone knows usâ€”someone will be glad to help you. If you can't find anyone, call us from a public phone, and we'll come get you.

(it's an example from a time where GPS and Google Maps weren't that common)

I was amazed by this. To know what heuristics is. I noticed that it's quite common to get myself looking for the "heuristics" for doing something instead of blindly accepting the algorithm being offered. It's good to know it has a name.

What I was used to say: "I don't want to just solve **this** problem. I want to **know how to solve** the same kind of problem everytime I face it."

Now I can say: "I'm looking for the heuristics to solve this problem."


#### Software Constructions = Building Construction

> Treating software construction as similar to building construction suggests that careful preparation is needed and illuminates the difference between large and small projects.

A project with double the original size costs more than double the original budget.

> In building a house, you won't try to build things you can buy already built. You'll buy a washer and dryer, dishwasher, refrigerator, and freezer. Unless you're a mechanical wizard, you won't consider building them yourself. (...) If you're building a software system, you'll do the same thing. You'll make extensive use of high-level language features rather than writing your own operating-system-level codce. You might also use prevuilt libraries of container classes, scientific functions, user interface classes, and database-manipulation classes. It generally doesn't make sense to code things you can buy ready-made.
> If you're building a fancy house with first-class furnishings, however, you might have your cabinets custom-made. (...) You might have windows custom-made in unusual shapes and sizes. This customization has parallels in software development. If you're building a first-class software product, you might build your own scientific functions for better speed or accuracy. You might build your own container classes, user interface classes, and database classes to give your system a seamless, perfectly consistent look and feel.

It generally costs less to use pre-built components than coding all of them from scratch.

> Choosing the right tool for each problem is one key to being an effective programmer.
