Things to take a look if/when I need to dive into Python language:

- <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/> to get a quick glance at the syntax
- <https://exercism.io/tracks/python/>
- <https://testdriven.io/guides/complete-python/> - looks interesting. Talks about setting up a Python development environment (linting, TDD, etc.)
- <https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/> - a FreeCodeCamp course, where you can track your progress
