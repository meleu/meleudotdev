# Python

See also [[Python Essentials - linuxtips]].

Things to take a look if/when I need to dive into Python language:

- <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/> - official tutorial
- <https://exercism.io/tracks/python/>
- <https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/> to get a quick glance at the syntax
- <https://testdriven.io/guides/complete-python/> - looks interesting. Talks about setting up a Python development environment (linting, TDD, etc.)
