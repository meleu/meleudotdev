# Long-term games and Compound interests

Some quotes from <https://nav.al/long-term>

> all the benefits in life come from compound interests. Whether it's in relationships, or making money, or in learning.

> You have to be able to play a long-term game. And long-term games are good not just for compound interest, they're also good for trust.

> if you want to be successful, you have to work with other people. And you have to figure out who can you trust, and who can you trust over a long, long period of time, that you can just keep playing the game with them, so that compound interest, and high trust will make it easier to play the game, and will let you collect the major rewards, which are usually at the end of the cycle.
>
> So, for example, Warren Buffet has done really well as an investor, but the biggest reason he could do that was because U.S. stock market has been stable, and around, and didn't get, for example, seized by the government during a bad administration. (...) The underlying platform didn't get destroyed. So, in his case, he was playing a longterm game. And the trust came from the U.S. stock market's stability.


> (...) a good leader doesn't take credit. A good leader basically tries to inspire people, so the team gets the job done.
