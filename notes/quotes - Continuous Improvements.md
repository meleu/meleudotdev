## Perfect Lawn
From [[Pragmatic Programmer]]

> A tourist visiting England's Eton College asked the gardener how he got the lawns so perfect.
> 
> -- That's easy, you just brush off the dew every morning, mow them every other day, and roll them once a week.
> 
> -- Is that all?
> 
> -- Absolutely. Do that for 500 years and you'll have a nice lawn, too.


## Quality is a road

> Quality is a road, not a destination.
