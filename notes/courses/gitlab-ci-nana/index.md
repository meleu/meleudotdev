Nothing really new for me in sections 1, 2 and 3.

- [[04 - GitLab Architecture]]

## 05 - CI/CD pipeline for Node.js Application

Repository: <https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/mynodeapp-cicd-project>

### 2 - Run Unit Tests & Collect Test Reports

In the app used as an example, the tests generate a `junit.xml` file that can be parsed by GitLab and show as a report in the web interface.

To show the report generated by the jest-junit in the gitlab we need to add this to our `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
# ...

run_unit_tests:
  # ...
  artifacts:
    when: always
    reports:
      junit: app/junit.xml
```

Another useful thing about these reports in the GitLab's UI is in the Merge Requests page. It shows the tests that failed.
