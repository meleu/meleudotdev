# Programming Principles

- One of our main concerns is to handle complexity (from [[Code Complete]]).
- The best feature of a software is how easy it is to change it.
- Part of your job is to educate your boss about technology (from [[Code Complete]]).

## Separation between intention and implementation

> If you have to spend effort into looking at a fragment of code to figure out *what* it's doing, then you should extract it into a function and name the function after that "what".
> -- Martin Fowler

## Opportunity Cost

> Life is short and you don't get to learn more than a tiny fraction of the knowledge and skills available, so if you want to make really cool stuff then you need to spend most of your time on the highest-leverage options and spend only a little time on the lottery tickets.

## Intelligence trumps expertise

> People who actually make progress are the ones who are keenly aware of the bounds of their own knowledge, are intensely curious about the gaps and are willing to learn from others and from the past. (...) Curiosity and lack of ego is a fast path to expertise.

## Speed Matters

> You can improve your coding speed a lot by improving simple mechanical skills which are easy to measure, practice and improve. It's a lot easier to get faster at coding then it is to get better at choosing the right idea!
