# video - Journal Exercise - Fear Setting

The exercise starts at 3:15

### Fear Setting exercise

| Define | Prevent | Repair |
| ------ | ------- | ------ |
|        |         |        |

**Define**: define your fear

**Prevent**: what you should do to prevent that from happening

**Repair**: what you should do if what you planned to prevent don't work. It's defining your worst-case scenario, your plan-b.

Check if your "plan-b" is that bad. If it's an OK scenario, take it as an encouragement to take the risk and face your fear. After all, if you fail, your plan-b is still a good one!
