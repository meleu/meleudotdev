# Principles of a Software Engineer

My principles related to my profession.

- **Primary technical imperative: Managing Complexity**

- I want the reading of code to be easy, even if it makes the writing harder.
    - We read code much more than we write.
    - In order to write code we need to read code (evidence that easy to read is priority over writing AND easier to read means easier to write)
