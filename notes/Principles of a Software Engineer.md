# Principles of a Software Engineer

My principles related to my profession.

- **Primary technical imperative: Managing Complexity**
    - Complexity causes:
        - harder communication between team members, which leads to deficiencies in the product, **increased costs**, and **delayed schedule**.
        - difficulty in list and understand all possible states of a program, which causes lack of confidence.
        - difficulty to evolve the software without creating side effects.
        - unnoticed states, which leads to security vulnerabilities

- I want the reading of code to be easy, even if it makes the writing harder.
    - We read code much more than we write.
    - In order to write code we need to read code (evidence that easy to read is priority over writing AND easier to read means easier to write)
    - **I want my code to be a quick skim, not an intense study.**


## draft

The real cost of coding is in the reading ([[99 Bottles of OOP]])

It doesn't matter if you code is to be handled by a human or AI agent, the more verbose it is, the more expensive it is.
