# Go Lang

I'm learning Golang and taking notes in this repo: [learning-golang](https://github.com/meleu/learning-golang)

I'm mostly following this book: <https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/>

Other material that looks promising:

- <https://yourbasic.org/golang/gotcha/>
- 

Material in portuguese (that I didn't tried):

- <https://aprendago.com>
- <https://aprendagolang.com.br/>

## links

- https://github.com/allaboutapps/go-starter - An opinionated production-ready SQL-/Swagger-first RESTful JSON API written in Go, highly integrated with VSCode DevContainers by allaboutapps.
