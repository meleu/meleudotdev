### The GCP resource hierarchy

- Org Node
    - Projects
        - Folders [optional]
            - other Folders [optional]
        - Resources (VMs, Storage, etc.)

Important: policies are inherited downwards in the hierarchy

Any GCP resource belongs to a project.

**Projects are the basis for enabling and using GCP services.**

**Each project is a separate compartment, and each resource belongs to exactly one.**

Projects can have different owners and users. They're billed separately, and they're managed separately.

Each project has a name and a project ID.

Project ID vs. Project name vs. Project number:

| Project Id      | Project name       | Project Number  |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Globally unique | Need not be unique | Globally unique |
| Chosen by you   | Chosen by you      | Assigned by GCP |
| Immutable       | Mutable            | Immutable       |

> In general, project IDs are made to be human-readable strings, and you'll use them frequently to refer to projects.

You can use folders to help you to manage your organization's projects.

- Folders group projects under an organization
- Folders can contain projects, other folders, or both
- Use folders to assign policies

**Caution!**

To use folders, you need an organization node at the top of the hierarchy.

**Important rule to keep in mind**

Policies implemented at a higher level can NOT take away access that's granted at a lower level.

"The most generous policy, is the one that takes effect." - doubt: an "allow" in the top of the hierarchy has precedence over a "deny" in the specific resource?
