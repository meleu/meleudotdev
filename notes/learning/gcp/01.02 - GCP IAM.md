### Identity and Access Management

An IAM defines 3 things:

- who
- can do what
- on which resource


#### who

The "who" part can be defined either by:

- Google account
- Google group
- Service account
- an entire G Suite or cloud identity domain


#### can do what

Defined by an IAM role.

An IAM role is a collection of permissions.

Three types of roles

1. Primitive
2. Predefined
3. Custom

##### Primitive roles

Primitive are broad. You apply them to a project and they affect all resources in that project.

Primitive roles:

- Owner
- Editor
- Viewer
- Billing administrator

**Careful**: if you have several people working together on a project that contains sensitive data, primitive roles are probably not enough. IAM provides a finer-grained types of roles.

GCP services offer their own sets of predefines roles, and they define where those roles can be applied.


##### Predefined roles

There was an example talking about the "InstanceAdmin" role, but it was really quick.


##### Custom roles

Allows more even control to achieve the "least privilege" principle.

**Cautions**:

1. You have to decide to use custom roles (some companies prefer to stick with the predefined roles).
2. Custom roles can only be used at the project or organization levels.

##### Service Account

When you want to give permissions to a machine instead of a user.
