## Basics

For most applications you need 3 three core elements:

- Compute
- Storage
- Networking

If you have on-premises app, on your own server, you can do a "lift & shift migration". Which means taking your app to a Virtual Machine.

Compute Engine = Iaas

App Engine = PaaS

- App Engine vs. Compute Engine
    - In most cases, using App Engine is a better solution than using virtual machines
    - If you have an application that's not a web or mobile app, then you can't use App Engine, so you'll have to use a VM.


Cloud Run: lets you runa container using a single command.
