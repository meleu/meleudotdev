# Getting Started with GCP

## Introduction

IAM - Identity and Access Management

**Projects** are the main way you organize the resources you use in GCP. Use them when you want to group a common business objective.

[[Principle of least privilege]]:

> Each user should have only those privileges needed to do their jobs.

This way people are protected from an entire class of errors.

In GCP we use IAM to implement least privilege.

Four ways to interact with GCP management layers:

1. **web based console**
2. **SDK & CLI tools**
3. APIs
4. mobile app

In the image below we can see in blue the parts which are still users' reponsibility, and in yellow what's Google's reponsibility.
