### Interacting with GCP

 Four ways to interact with GCP management layers:

1. **web based console**
2. **SDK & CLI tools**
3. APIs
4. mobile app

#### web based console

If you build an application in GCP, you'll use the web based console; although the end users of your application won't.

It provides you full access to the GCP resources. It also lets you enable, disable and explore the APIs of GCP services.

It also gives you access to the Google's Cloud Shell, from your browser.


#### Google Cloud SDK 

Accessible via:

- web browser (cloud shell)
- you can install in your computer
- docker image

Includes command line tools, like `gcloud` (the main CLI tool), `gsutil` (Cloud Storage), `bq` (BigQuery).


#### RESTful APIs

Your code can pass information to the APIs using JSON.

The GCP console lets you turn on and off APIs.

Experiment with the **APIs Explorer**. It's an interactive tool that lets you easily try Google APIs using a browser.

[Sounds like an interesting way to play with code ðŸ¤“]


#### Cloud Console Mobile App

- Manage VMs and DB instances
- Manage apps in Google App Engine
- Manage your billing
- Visualize your projects with a customizable dashboard


### Cloud Marketplace

A solution marketplace containing pre-packaged, ready-to-deploy solutions. Some offered by Google, others by third-party vendors.
