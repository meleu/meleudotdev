## Introducing GCP

- Welcome to GCP Fundamentals
    - this course focus on Compute Engine and basics of Networking

- What is Cloud computing?
    - Cloud computing is a way of using IT that has these 5 traits:
        1. On-demand self-service: no human intervention needed to get resources
        2. Broad network access: access from anywhere
        3. Resource pooling: provider shares resources to customers
        4. Rapid elasticity: Get more resources quickly as needed
        5. Measured service: Pay only for what you consume.

- How did we get here?
    - Physical/Colocations: User-configured, managed and maintained.
    - Virtualized: User-configured. Provider-managed and maintained.
    - Serverless: Fully automated.

- [[Every company is a data company]]:
    - At some point, most of software will be considered as a commodity. Therefore the most valuable asset of a company will be the data it has about the users.

- GCP computing archtectures
    - Compute Engine: IaaS
    - Kubernetes Engine: Hybrid
    - App Engine: PaaS
    - Cloud Functions: Serverless logic
    - Managed Services: Automated elastic resources

- The Google network / GCP regions and zones
    - Think in a zone as a single point of failure within a region

- Google offers customer-friendly pricing
    - Billing in sub-hour increments
    - Discounts for sustained use
    - Discounts for committed use
    - Discounts for preemptible use
    - Custom VM instance types

- Open API
    - GCP uses open APIs and it helps to prevent vendor lock-in

- Why choose GCP?
    - "GCP enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications on Google's highly secure, reliable and scalable infrastructure."
