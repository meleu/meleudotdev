## Right Click

In Mac it's also called Secondary Click.

- Ctrl + click

On ABNT2 keyboard I need to do this:

## Shortcuts

[[Top+macOS+Ventura+-+AppleOnlineAcademy.pdf]]

- Cmd+M = minimize

- F11 = show desktop
- Cmd+H = hide
- Option+Cmd+Esc = force quite dialog
- Option+Cmd+D = Show/Hide Dock
- Trackpad pinch with threefingers+thumb = Launchpad


### Screenshot tools

**NOTE**: add Ctrl to save in the clipboard instead of a file

- Cmd+Shift+3 = full screenshot

## Uninstall Apps

1. Launchpad
    - hold Option and click the little `x` (not always available)
2. Finder -> Applications
    - drag the app icon to the trash
3. install an app cleaner

## Disable CapsLock

NOTE: To use the CapsLock as backspace this config must NOT be done

Keyboard Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Modifier Keys -> CapsLock = No Action


## Enable CapsLock as Backspace
