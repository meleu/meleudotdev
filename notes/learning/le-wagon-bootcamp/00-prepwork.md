## Web 101

Main concepts:

- internet vs web
- HTTP
    - client and server
    - request and response
- static vs dynamic websites
- backend vs frontend

## Web Content & HTML

Basic HTML stuff.

I'm considering taking this emmet course before the Bootcamp: <https://www.linkedin.com/learning/emmet-fast-and-efficient-web-coding>

Things to remember:

- HTML basic syntax: `<element attribute="value">content</element>`
- `<img>` tags are self-closing
- in an `<a>` used for link, the `target` attribute can have the value `blank` to open the link in a new tab (btw, this is not a very intuitive thing).

Useful links mentioned at the end of the module:

- Accessibility:

    - [Accessible to all](https://web.dev/accessible/)
- SEO:
