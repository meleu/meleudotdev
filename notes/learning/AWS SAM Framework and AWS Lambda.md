# AWS SAM Framework and AWS Lambda

- <https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-sam-framework-and-aws-lambda/>
- official docs for AWS SAM Framework: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html>

SAM = Serverless Application Model

> [!note]
> The AWS Serverless Application Model is a different framework than [**The** Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com).


## 3. Development Environment Setup

### Setup an AWS Profile

AWS Console -> IAM -> Users -> Add users

- User name: `serverless-admin`
- Select AWS credential type:
    - [ ] Access key - Programmatic access
- next ->
- Attach existing policies directly
    - [ ] `AdministratorAccess`
- next ->
- Tags (do whatever you want)
- next ->
- Confirm create user

Take note of your **Access key ID** and **Secret access key**.

Then run:
```shell
# apparently it needs the 'serverless' tool to be installed
# check https://serverless.com
serverless config credentials \
  --provider aws \
  --key "${accessKeyId}" \
  --secret "${secretAccessKey}" \
  --profile serverless-admin
```


### Install VSCode and Setup AWS Toolkit

Install VSCode and install the plugin named "AWS Toolkit".

If you're already connected to AWS through the CLI, just run in your VSCode `Ctrl+Shift+P` and then `AWS: Connect to AWS` (maybe you'll need to run `AWS: Create Credentials Profile`, go figure it out).

### Install AWS CLI

I've installed on Linux using [the instructions here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions).
```shell
curl \
  "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" \
  -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```


### Setting up AWS Configurations

To know which user is logged into AWS, use this command:
```shell
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

If you want to change the user:
```shell
aws configure
```


### Install Docker

Recently I've been using the Docker Desktop. But I have these notes about docker installation:

- [[Docker Installation]]
- [[Docker Installation - udemy]]


### Install AWS SAM CLI

Followed the installations from [the docs here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html).
```shell
# installed with brew
brew tap aws/tap
brew install aws-sam-cli
```



## 4. AWS SAM Framework in depth

AWS SAM stands for **Serverless Application Model**, it's used to define your serverless application

AWS SAM consists of the following components:

- **AWS SAM Template Specification** - you write properties to a file to describe functions, APIs, permissions, etc.
- **AWS SAM CLI** - to invoke function, packages and deploy serverless applications to AWS Cloud and so on.

AWS SAM CLI aims to ease the pain of creating, deploying managing and debugging lambda functions.


### Creating and Running our first AWS SAM Application

```shell
# initialize and follow the instructions for a HelloWorld
sam init
# that will create a directory with the name of the app

# assuming the app name is 'sam-hello-world'
# open the project in vscode
code sam-hello-world

# building the project
sam build

# invoking the function locally
sam local invoke
```

I had this issue to run the function locally (even with Docker Desktop running):
```
$ sam local invoke
Error: Running AWS SAM projects locally requires Docker. Have you got it installed and running?
```

Solved following the instructions [here in the issue tracker](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli/issues/4329#issuecomment-1289588827).
```shell
# check the docker context
# (it was 'desktop-linux')
docker info | grep -i context

# get the DOCKER_ENDPOINT for 'desktop-linux'
docker context ls

# run the 'sam' command with DOCKER_HOST properly filled
DOCKER_HOST=unix:///home/meleu/.docker/desktop/docker.sock sam local invoke
```

What was awesome from this technique is that the function was not even deployed to AWS. Everything ran locally!


### Deploying the AWS SAM App

```shell
sam deploy --guided
```

Answers used during the course:
![[aws-sam-deploy-guided.png]]

After it finishes, test the endpoint created.


### Hosting the API locally

```shell
sam local start-api
```

Then test it by sending a GET request to `localhost:3000/hello`.

### Invoke your Lambda Function directly

Check the `Resources` in the `template.yaml` file. In this case we want to invoke the `HelloWorldFunction`:

```shell
sam local invoke "HelloWorldFunction"

# in the video he used this
sam local invoke "HelloWorldFunction" -e events/event.json
# I didn't get why exactly the 
# '-e events/event.json' is needed
```


### Deleting the Stack

```shell
# list the stacks you have
aws cloudformation list-stacks

# delete the one created in the previous sections
aws cloudformation delete-stack \
  --stack-name ${appName}
  --region ${awsRegion}
```



## 5. AWS SAM and AWS Toolkit in VSCode

In VSCode, `> AWS: Create Lambda SAM Application` and follow the instructions on the screen to create a Hello World with Python

It'll create a directory with the app files.

Again, a VSCode command: `> AWS: Deploy SAM Application`.

In my system, for some reason, that ðŸ‘† command is not present. Then I deployed via CLI: `sam deploy --guided`.







## 6. AWS SAM Deep Dive - SAM Specifications

```shell
sam init
# 1 - quickstart
# 2 - serverless api
# 3 - nodejs16
# n - no X-Ray
# Project name: test-sam-app

# then build the project
cd test-sam-app
sam build
```


### YAML Crash Course

I learned something useful in this lecture: the `&` and `*` notations in a YAML file.

Example: this input:
```yaml
author: &jPaul
  name: James
  lastName: Paul

books:
  - 1923:
      author: *jPaul
  - My Biography:
      author: *jPaul
```

Generates this JSON output:
```json
{
  "author": {
    "lastName": "Paul", 
    "name": "James"
  },
  "books": [
    {
      "1923": {
        "author": {
          "lastName": "Paul", 
          "name": "James"
        }
      }
    }, 
    {
      "My Biography": {
        "author": {
          "lastName": "Paul", 
          "name": "James"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```


### AWS Lambda and SAM Framework Core Concepts

- Function
    - independent unit of deployment
    - best practice: does a single job.
    - examples:
        - save user to DynamoDB
        - convert large image into a thumbnail
- Events
    - anything that triggers a Lambda function
    - examples:
        - API Gateway HTTP endpoints
        - S3 bucket upload
- Resources
    - infrastructure components used by the Lambda function
    - examples:
        - DynamoDB Table (saving a comment)
        - S3 bucket (saving audio files)
        - SNS (sending messages asynchronously)
- Services
    - Framework's unit organization (project file).
    - Where you define the Functions, the Events and the Resources.
    - Can be described in YAML or JSON


### AWS Functions Timeout and Memory

Let's define two Lambda functions and tweak the timeout and memory.

```shell
sam init
# 1 - template
# 1 - HelloWorld
# Python
# X-Ray: no
# name: sam-time-memory
```

Go to the `hello_world/app.py` and add something like this:
```py
# ...
import time

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    time.sleep(4)
    # ...
```

This will make the function sleep for 4 seconds.

Open the `template.yaml` and notice that `Globals.Function.Timeout` is set to `3`.

Build and run the function and see it failing due to timeout:
```shell
sam build && sam local invoke
```

You can also set the timeout for a specific function using  `Resources.${FunctionName}.Properties.Timeout`. In fact, this is how to override the value from the `Globals`.

Play with these values and see what happens.


### IAM Permissions for Lambda Functions

By default a Lambda function doesn't have permissions to access other services (example: access to S3 buckets or DynamoDB data). To solve this we need to provide an IAM policy.

In this example we're giving to our function permission to list lambda functions. In the `template.yaml` we must add this to `Resources.${FunctionName}.Properties`:
```yaml
Resources:
  ${FunctionName}:
    Properties:
      Policies:
        Version: "2012-10-17"
        Statement:
          - Effect: "Allow"
            Action:
              - "lambda:*"
            Resource:
             "*"
```


### Environment Variables

Useful to provide external configuration to your functions.

We just need to edit our `template.yaml`:
```yaml
# if defined Globals, the variable
# is accessible by all functions
Globals:
  Function:
    Environment:
      Variables:
        KEY: "VALUE"

# you can also define env variables
# at function's level
Resources:
  ${FunctionName}:
    Properties:
      Environment:
        Variables:
          KEY: "VALUE"
```


### VPC for Lambda Functions

VPC = Virtual Private Clouds

Many companies use VPC to privately deploy their applications. By default Lambda functions are **NOT** launched in a VPC.

You can launch Lambda in your VPC, so it can security access EC2 instances, RDS instances or any other instance in your VPC.

You can also assign security groups to your Lambda functions as well, for enhanced network security!

You can choose to deploy your Lambda function in any subnets you like. This will allow your Lambda function to inherit a private IP from that subnet.

**Get the `${subnetID}`**:

To get the subnet ID go to AWS Console and search for `VPC`, click on it. Then go to `Your VPCs`, chose one. Then click on `Subnets`. You'll see the list of Subnets with their respective IDs

**Get the `${securityGroup}`**:

Also in the VPC screen, left sidebar, Security -> Security groups. Select a security group or create a new one.

Add this to your `template.yaml`:
```yaml
Globals:
  Function:
    VpcConfig:
      SecurityGroupIds:
        - "${securityGroup}"
      SubnetIds:
        - "${subnetID}"
```

### AWS Lambda Pricing

<https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/>

Current pricing, as of Feb 2022:

- Pay per **calls**:
    - Frist 1,000,000 requests are free
    - $0.20 per million requests thereafter
- Pay per **duration**:
    - 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month FREE
    - == 400,000 second if function is 1GB RAM
    - == 3,200,000 second if function is 128MB RAM
    - you need to understand what your functions need for it to run and adjust accordingly

Moral of the story: it's usually **very cheap** to run AWS Lambda, that's why it's very popular.

You pay as you go - if your app doesn't use the Lambda functions, or they don't get trigger, then you don't get billed for them!
