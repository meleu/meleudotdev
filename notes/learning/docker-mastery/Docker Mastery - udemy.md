## Intro

The 3 docker innovations:

- docker image
- docker registry
- docker container


Major Linux features used by Docker:

- Namespaces
- cgroups
- veth
- iptables
- union mount


Why Docker? Why now?

3 reasons:

- isolation: better isolation in a single OS
- environments: reduced environment variances
- speed: increase speed of change

## My goals

Besides the foundational knowledge needed to go on with kubernetes, I also want the docker knowledge to achieve these:

- use a `docker-compose` to make it simple to run the RetroAchievements website in a development environment.
- get the tools needed to deploy <https://docs.retroachievements.org/>.
- get the tools needed to deploy <https://news.retroachievements.org/>.
- create a network like the one illustrated in the first page of the book "TCP/IP Illustrated" (vol 1, 1st edition) by Richard Stevens.
- **ambitious**: get the tools needed to build RetroArch for Windows, Linux, Android, Raspberry Pi (ARM processors).
