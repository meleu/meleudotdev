## Node Selectors

Nodes with different resources.

You'd like to spawn more demanding apps to be run in the most powerful node

```yaml
# pod's definition
spec:
  containers:
  # containers definition
  nodeSelector:
    size: Large # node's key-value label
```

How to setup complex situations like: "Large OR Medium" and "NOT Small"?

Because of such limitations, the Node Affinity feature was created.
