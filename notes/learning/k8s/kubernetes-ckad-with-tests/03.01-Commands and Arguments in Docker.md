## Commands and Arguments in Docker

### `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in Dockerfile

The `CMD` instruction says which command is to be run when the container starts. This is the command to be run while the container is alive. When this command finishes or crashes, the container finishes.

Example:
```Dockerfile
# image name: ubuntu-sleeper
FROM ubuntu

# sleep for 5 seconds
CMD sleep 5
```

It can be overwritten in the command line:
```bash
docker container run ubuntu-sleeper sleep 10
# command at startup: sleep 10
```

The `CMD` instruction also accepts an "array notation":
```Dockerfile
# CMD command param1 paramN

CMD ["command", "param1", "paramN"]
```


If you want your image to have always the same command, but let the user set an argument, use the `ENTRYPOINT` instruction:
```Dockerfile
# image name: ubuntu-sleeper
FROM ubuntu

ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
```

Now you can just pass the argument in the docker command:
```bash
docker container run ubuntu-sleeper 10
# command at startup: sleep 10
```

If you don't pass an argument, the resulting command is going to be `sleep` which generates an error.


You can also have the same command and a default argument:
```Dockerfile
# image name: ubuntu-sleeper
FROM ubuntu

ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]

CMD ["5"]
```

This way you can use the default command or pass an argument to overwrite the default one:
```bash
docker container run ubuntu-sleeper
# command at startup: sleep 5

docker container run ubuntu-sleeper 10
# command at startup: sleep 10
```

And if you want to overwrite the entrypoint:
```bash
docker container run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu-sleeper 10
# command at startup: sleep2.0 10
```


### `command` and `args` in Pod's definition

If you want to overwrite `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` in the Pod's definition file, use the `command` and `args` keys.

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:
  name: ubuntu-sleeper-pod

spec:
  containers:
    - name: ubuntu-sleeper
      image: ubuntu-sleeper
      
      # overwrites ENTRYPOINT
      command: ["sleep2.0"]
      
      # overwrites CMD
      args: ["10"]
```

**Note**: remember that `CMD` is **NOT** overwritten by the `command` key, but by `args`.
