He mentions that a rich life for him is specific. Example: using a taxi instead of subway.

We see more articles/advices about how to save, not about how to spend.

Money is the byproduct of doing all these right things.

One of my philosophies is to:

> spend extravagantly on the things you love as long as you cut costs mercilessly on the things you don't.


Questions:

- [10:15] What is something you spent money on in the last two weeks that made you smile?
- [17:55] What is something you love spending money on?
- [25:10] What if you could quadruple your spending on that thing you love?



Ramit's money rules:

1. Always have 1 year of emergency funds, cash
2. Save 10% and invest 20% of gross income, minimum
3. Pay cash for large expenses. 20% down, minimum on a house.
4. Never question spending money on books, appetizers, health, or donating to a friend's charity fundraiser.
5. Business class on flights over 4 hours.
6. No limit on spending for health (personal trainer) or education (courses, events, etc.).
7. Buy the best and keep it for as long as possible.
8. **Earn enough to work only with people I respect and like**
9. Marry the right person.
10. Prioritize time outside the spreadsheet.
