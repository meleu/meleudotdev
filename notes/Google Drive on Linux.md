# Google Drive on Linux

## PopOS! / GNOME

> [!warning]

First try was using the "Online Accounts" configs of GNOME in PopOS. The file manager shows my google drive (note: it didn't work on the first try). But it's only visible in the Gnome's File Manager (not accessible in the terminal).

## google-drive-ocamlfuse

Looks promising! ðŸ™‚

Following the instructions to [mount using systemd](https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse/wiki/Automounting#mount-using-systemd)

1. Create the file `~/.config/systemd/user/gdrive.service` (replace `${label}` and `${mountPoint}` with proper values):
```ini

[Service]
ExecStart=google-drive-ocamlfuse -label ${label} ${mountPoint}
ExecStop=fusermount -u ${mountPoint}
Restart=always
Type=forking

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
# mount the drive
systemctl start --user gdrive.service

# umount the drive
systemctl stop --user gdrive.service

# automount on boot
systemctl enable --user gdrive.service
```
