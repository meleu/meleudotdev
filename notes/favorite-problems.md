# Favorite Problems

Richard Feynman quote:

> You have to keep **a dozen of your favorite problems** constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, **test against each of your twelve problems** to see wheter it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say "How did he do it? **He must be a genius!**"

It doesn't need to be exactly 12. Here are mine ones:

1. The most important skills I need to be a full-stack webdeveloper
2. Clearer ways to write code
3. Best way to write less code
4. Modelling - the act of creating models of the world (and converting it into software)
5. Basic frontend skills
6. Increase my communication skills
7. Talk while coding
8. Differentiate noise vs. signal
9. How to convince coworkers that "coding for maintenance" is a game changer.
