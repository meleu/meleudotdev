# The New Role of TDD in the Incoming AI Era

Now that ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are changing the programming landscape, TDD is more important than ever.

> from: <https://betterprogramming.pub/now-tdd-is-more-important-than-ever-dfaf65024d9>

These past few weeks, I have been writing a series of articles about how to apply BDD and TDD in developments with a hands-on approach. I want to continue on that, but I felt necessary to do a small pause.

TDD (Test Driven Development): discipline consisting in three rules:
1. Write the test until it fails,
2. Write the code until it passes the test
3. Clean both, and repeat.

Just a few days ago, I saw a twit with the following joke:

![[programming-wit-ai-before-after.png]]

After reading the joke, **I realized how different is the life of a programmer who uses TDD regularly versus one that does not**.

(...)

**In addition to the AI, we also discuss professionalism**, and what happens to a programmer when the code harms anyone (see [Don’t Screw Up, You Will Be Found Guilty](https://drpicox.medium.com/dont-screw-up-you-will-be-found-guilty-95b673319f78)). So, that, plus the fact that AI was written code, the inevitable question was raised by the audience:

> If an AI, like GitHub Copilot, writes a faulty code, who is responsible?

**The answer was clear in my case: mine**.

Why? I work with TDD, I write all the tests, and I verify that the code satisfies those tests. Because I use TDD, I see the tests fail, and I know that they test what they should test. So, when the AI writes the code if the test passes, I know that it works.

And my life continued using GitHub Copilot daily. I cannot believe that I have been using it for more than one year now. So, I got a lot of practice.

And a few days ago, I saw the joke that I have shown earlier in this story.

Can you guess why I saw in TDD becoming so important? Because initially, I didn’t get the joke. I had to put myself in the shoes of other developers to understand it. **What has TDD that makes that joke meaningless?** The fast iteration loop!

**With TDD, you never code for two hours. You should stop as soon as possible.** Try to always minimal changes, and re-execute tests. If at any moment something fails, [there is no need to debug](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-programmers-waste-time-1efd6427b26e), instead, [you can undo the last change and try again](https://betterprogramming.pub/to-boldly-code-like-never-before-a13df2e67679). So, you will never, or almost never, debug for hours. And all the code generated by any AI will serve only one purpose.

And now, let’s project into the future. Currently, AIs write very primitive code. Ok, they are impressive, but there is a series of tasks that they are incapable of yet. Like, for example, creating a [smart code architecture](https://drpicox.medium.com/the-smartest-code-architecture-84b8277d4763).

Currently, **I use TDD to guide the LLM and write and rewrite the pieces that I want**. I remove the parts that have to be changed, I create new files or skeletons for the code, and I let the AI fill the gap. I have even seen how, on some occasions, the AI had read the tests, and filled the code accordingly.

So, someday, it does not seem a stupid idea to think that AI will write all the code, and even, refactor it and change its architecture. But even in the case that AI would become limited only to creating big monolithic chunks of code, who cares? For every change, we should only add the required new tests, remove all the code, and let the AI rewrite everything in a few minutes.

Because **the value is not in the code, but in the tests**. Because the tests are the culmination of all the learning process that we have done about the domain. If you have not yet, I recommend you to read “[The Two Disks Parable](https://drpicox.medium.com/the-two-disks-parable-ac1a16803c58)”.

And, **let’s go one step further**. With tools like [Gherkin and BDD](https://medium.com/codex/is-it-true-the-extraordinary-claim-of-dan-north-about-bdd-e9d1038b4bc), we can focus better on the domain, and on the problem to solve, and let the AI do the work.

So now you understand why I say that TDD leaves the joke meaningless, and makes the AI so good companion.
