## Day 1: How to begin

**Main takeaways**

Start with soft marks. Pay attention at the drawings of great masters and notice that they start with incredibly light lines.

How to hold the pencil:

Why this ðŸ‘† way? Because it allows more soft strokes.

Good analogy: drawing as sculpting. The soft lines you do first are the raw material and then you start "sculpting" it to have the shape you're looking for.

First marks that you put on your page are not intended to be a perfect representation of what you want.


#### Assignment

Practice drawing light lines for 30 minutes.

- Goals:
    - get comfortable drawing lightly.
    - discover how light is right for you


## Day 2: Circles and Ovals

- Use your shoulder
- Keep your lines as light as possible
- Do the circular movements before touching the paper with your pencil

> When I was learning how to draw circles and ovals mys instructor told me that I needed to fill ten pages, front and back, with circles and ovals every morning for a year.
