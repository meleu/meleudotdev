In order to make the bootable live disk, you must have a flash drive and software to write the `.iso` image to the drive. For this tutorial, we'll use the Disks utility.

Launch the Disks application.

Next select the flash drive in the list on left and click on the three dots on the top right of the window. Now select `Restore Disk Image...` and select the Ubuntu or Pop_OS ISO file. Finally, click the `Start Restoring...` button and enter your user password.

Once the flash is complete (should look like the screenshot above), it's time to boot it up on the machine that you want to install the OS on.
