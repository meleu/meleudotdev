# TDD/Refactoring literature

I'm interested in being specialized in refactoring. It requires a strong knowledge about TDD.

In this article I'm trying to list the fundamental books about these topics.

- Test-Drive Development: By Example - Kent Beck
- Trabalho Eficaz com Código Legado - Michael Feathers
- Refatoração: Aperfeiçoando o Design de Códigos Existentes - martin Fowler
- Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change - Kent Beck
- Clean Craftsmanship: Disciplines, Standards, and Ethics - Robert Martin
