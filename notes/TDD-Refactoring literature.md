# TDD/Refactoring literature

While reading [[Desenvolvimento Agil Limpo]] I became interested in a deep dive in refactoring. It requires a strong knowledge about TDD.

In this note I'm trying to list some fundamental books about these topics.

## online courses

- my very first contact was with [[ruby minitest cheatsheet]]
- then I went to [[RSpec - udemy]]
- and got some interesting insights from upcase's [Fundamentals of TDD](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/fundamentals-of-tdd).
