# TDD/Refactoring literature

While reading [[Desenvolvimento Agil Limpo]] I became interested in a deep dive in refactoring. It requires a strong knowledge about TDD.

In this note I'm trying to list some fundamental books about these topics.

## online courses

- my very first contact was with [[ruby minitest]]
- then I went to [[RSpec - udemy]]
- and got some interesting insights from upcase's [Fundamentals of TDD](https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/fundamentals-of-tdd).
- Rails Testing Exercises (upcase): <https://thoughtbot.com/upcase/rails-testing-exercises>

## must read

- Test-Drive Development: By Example - Kent Beck (iff: B393t / 005.14)
- Understanding the Four Rules of Simple Design - Corey Haines - [link](https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign)
- [[Clean Code]] - Robert Martin
- Refatoração: Aperfeiçoando o Design de Códigos Existentes - Martin Fowler

- [[eXtreme Programming Explained]]: Embrace Change - Kent Beck (iff: B393p / 005.1)
