# random avatar for placeholders

Cool service to get placeholders for user avatars:
<https://pravatar.cc/>

example, if you want to pick a random one with 200x200px, use this url:  
<https://i.pravatar.cc/200>

if you want to see all avatars available, [click here](https://pravatar.cc/images) (btw, [this is my favorite one](https://i.pravatar.cc/400?img=22))
