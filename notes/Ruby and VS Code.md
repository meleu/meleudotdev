# Ruby and VS Code

## Solargraph: enable InteliSense and Ruby docs

With [Solargraph](https://solargraph.org) you can have context-aware autocompletion and offline documentation (between other features).

Enabling it on VS Code is pretty simple:

1. install the gem:
```shell
gem install solargraph
```
2. install the [Ruby Solargraph VS Code plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph)

That's enoug.

**Bonus**: if you have your [VS Code integrated with Neovim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim), you can check the documentation with `K`.

### Configuring RuboCop
