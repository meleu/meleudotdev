## Migrating to neovim

List of features I really use and that is what make me open vscode instead of neovim.

- git management
- quickly change branches
- extensions
    - run tests (neovim equivalent: [neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest))
    - coverage gutters (neovim equivalent: [nvim-coverage](https://github.com/andythigpen/nvim-coverage))
    - open on github
    - gitblame (gitsigns josean 1:21, typecraft git)
    - git diff
    - enable/disable github copilot
    - auto-session
    - trouble 
    - autoformat (neovim: conform josean 1:14)
    - todo comments 
    - github-actions - this is quite handy when I'm working with GH workflows
