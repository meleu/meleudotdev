# Google Cloud Build

Reading <https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview> I stumbled upon a really interesting information:

> ##### Running builds locally
> 
> If you want to test your build before submitting it to Cloud Build, you can run your build locally using the `cloud-build-local` tool. For instructions on using this tool see the [Building and Debugging Locally](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-debug-locally) page.

So, read this is going to be useful: <https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/build-debug-locally>
