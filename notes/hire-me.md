## My principles

- Primary technical imperative: **managing complexity**.
- Writing clean and manageable code is the way to go faster.
- Act on the bottlenecks: "any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion."


## My interests

- Test-Driven Development.
- Clean Architecture
- Refactoring
- DevOps Culture


## Personal/side projects I've built from scratch

#### LogBots

A follow-up system for a local logistics company.

In the website, developed with PHP, the user uploads an Excel spreadsheet with the shipments' info, the data is parsed and persisted in a MySQL database.

I created an API and a telegram bot to interact with it. The drivers use the telegram bot to update the status of their deliveries.

This system is still in use today.


#### RADocs

Created tools that converts a github wiki into a beautiful documentation webpage.

- Repository: <https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs>
- Wiki: <https://github.com/RetroAchievements/docs/wiki/>
- Website: <https://docs.retroachievements.org/>


#### RABot

The RetroAchievements Discord Bot, consuming a lot of 3rd party APIs.

- Repository: https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RABot
- Discord Server where it runs: <https://discord.gg/dq2E4hE>


#### RANews

RetroAchievements digital magazine. I've built this to learn more about CSS.
