# MVC

Model View Controller

- **Model**: what is the basic object you want to manipulate?
- **View**: this is the place where we **display information** to the user and **ask for information** from the user
- **Controller**: it will fetch and store data of the Model, and tell the view to show or gather data to and from the user.

> Even though the the abstraction layers look more like in this order: Model -> Controller -> View, I think it's called MVC because of the order the code is written.
