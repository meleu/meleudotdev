# MVC

Model View Controller

- **Model**: what is the basic object you want to manipulate?
- **View**: this is the place where we **display information** to the user and **ask for information** from the user
- **Controller**: it will fetch and store data of the Model, and tell the view to show or gather data to and from the user.

> I think it would make more sense if we called this pattern as MCV -> Model -> Controller -> View, as the layers from implementation to the user...
