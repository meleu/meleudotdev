# ðŸŒ± Information vs. Attention


I saw this in the [[Building a Second Brain]] book:

> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence wealth of information creates a poverty of attention...
> 
> \- Herbert Simon

[This article](https://compeap.com/a-wealth-of-information-creates-a-poverty-of-attention/) also mentions that quote.

Such idea made me remember something said by Scott Hanselman in [his famous talk about productivity](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/its-not-what-you-read-its-what-you-ignore-video-of-scott-hanselmans-personal-productivity-tips):

> The less you do, the more of it you can do.


Somehow it also made me remember this:
