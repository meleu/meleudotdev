# Practical Object-Oriented Design

### Being a programmer
I've found in the first pages of this book the reason why I love to be a programmer.

From "Introduction"

> Those of us whose work is to write software are incredibly lucky. Building software is a **guiltless pleasure** because we get to use our creative energy to get things done. We have arranged our lives to have it both ways; we can enjoy the pure act of writing code in sure knowledge that the code we write has use.

From 1.1 "In Praise of Design":

> If painful programming were the most cost-effective way to produce working software, programmers would be morally obligated to suffer stoically or to find other jobs.
> 
> Fortunately, you do not have to choose between pleasure and productivity. The programming techniques that make code a joy to write overlap with those that most efficiently produce software.


### Easy to change 

> Applications that are easy to change are a pleasure to write and enjoy to extend. They are flexible and adaptable. Applications that resist change are just the opposite; every change is expensive and each makes the next cost more.
