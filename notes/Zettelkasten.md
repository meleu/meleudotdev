- <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>


In the Zettelkasten system ideas must be atomic. Here are some atomic ideas I have:

- the importance of having principles
- having a shared myth is what allows humans to dominate the planet
- inveja
- vingan√ßa
- mediocridade
- vim - what to do after vimtutor
- vim - text objects
