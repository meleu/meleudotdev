### A Framework for Fighting the Syndrome

Before you embark on your next “modernization” project, ask yourself these questions:

1. **What specific problem am I solving?** Write it down. Be precise. “The tech is old” isn’t a problem; it’s an observation.
2. **What’s the smallest change that solves this problem?** Often, the solution is much simpler than a complete rewrite.
3. **What are the hidden costs?** Migration time, learning curve, new dependencies, potential bugs, ongoing maintenance … etc.
4. **Is my current solution actually causing problems?** Performance issues? Developer friction? Or is it just not the trendy choice?
5. **Where should my effort actually go?** In my case, writing more content would benefit my blog far more than switching frameworks.
