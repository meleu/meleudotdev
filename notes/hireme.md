## What I did/do


### Things I've built from scratch

#### LogBots

A follow-up system for a local logistics company.

In the website, developed with PHP, the user uploads an Excel spreadsheet with the shipments' info, the data is parsed and persisted in a MySQL database.

I created an API and a telegram bot to interact with it. The drivers use the telegram bot to update the status of their deliveries.

This system is still in use today and runs at https://logbots.app/

#### RADocs

Created tools that converts a github wiki into a beautiful documentation webpage.
