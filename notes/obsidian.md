# Obsidian

<https://obsidian.md>

Obsidian is a great piece of software that changed the way I manage my knowledge.

Here are some notes of things I do after a fresh install and that I like to show people when they're seeing Obsidian for the first time.

## Basic Settings

These are my preferences.

- [Stacked tabs](https://help.obsidian.md/User+interface/Tabs#Stack%20tab%20groups)
- Editor
    - Readable line length - turn on
    - Strict line breaks (for consistent markdown usage)
    - Use tabs - turn off (I prefer to use spaces).
    - Vim key binding (if you're a vim user)
- Files & Links
    - Automatically update internal links
    - Default location for new attachments (create an `assets` directory)
- Appearance
    - Advanced
        - Show inline title - turn off (it's confusing to have the filename presented as part of the file's content)
- Hotkeys
    - `Alt+S` - Toggle Live Preview/Source mode

## Core Plugins

- Templates
    - in the configs set the "Template folder location" (create a `templates` directory)

### Community Plugins

- Paste image rename
    - So you can automatically rename an image when you paste it into a note.
- Calendar
    - Useful for keeping your daily notes.
    - Note: I don't use it on my main vault. But it's pretty useful on my work's vault, so I can keep remember what I need to say during the Standup Daily Meeting.
- Advanced tables
    - Useful if you create tables using markdown.
    - Note: don't worry about it if you're a markdown newbie.
- Icon shortcodes (for emojis)
    - So I can use emojis like this: `:thinking_face:` -> 🤔
- Paste url into selection
    - So you can quickly paste a URL when a text is selected and create a link
- Obsidian Git
    - So you can automatically have a backup of your vault as a git repository.

### Plugins for advanced users

- dataview
    - [Nice video showing how to use it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yjNuiSBSAM)
- Obsidian Anki Sync
    - To create/update Anki flashcards
    - Note: the results are not really what I like the most, but the workflow to create/update the flashcards are smoother IMO.
- Digital Garden
    - To create a 🌱 [[digital garden]] like [mine one](https://meleu.netlify.app)

### Plugins I plan to try later

- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf3d7qyz17c>

- 00:25 - overview
- 02:00 - mindmap
    - help you to have an overview of the subject, and help you break it down to manage and plan.
- 02:55 - study plan
    - (with pomodor): helps you keep the focus on the revision notes.
- 03:50 - revision notes
    - help you bring in different sources and ideas about the topic.
- 05:40 - question set notes
    - Creating **question set notes** helps you prepare for your exam and actively thinking about the subject.
- 06:25 - question bank
    - Using a **question bank** like Anki helps you use spaced repetition and active recall.
- 09:30 - summary

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X61wRmfZU8Y) there's a mention to a plugin named review, where you can set a review day. Looks interesting
