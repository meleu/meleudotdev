# Parkinson's law

It's actually an adage that says:

> **work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.**

Given the Parkinson's law, use the [[pomodoro]] technique in your favor. It forces you to set a small timeframe and focus on your task.

Instead of yearly big ambitious goals, set weekly (smaller, achievable) goals.
