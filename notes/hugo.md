- <https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/> - this seems to be the best theme to be used for now
- <https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-hello-friend/> - minimalistic and elegant - seems to be a good fit for meleu.sh
- <https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/ronu-hugo-theme/> -really simple and clean - [demo](https://www.softwareyoga.com/)
- <https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-timeline/> - useful for when needing a timeline.
