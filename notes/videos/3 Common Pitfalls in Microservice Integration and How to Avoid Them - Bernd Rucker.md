Distributed Systems

According to an "adoption curve" by InfoQ (in 2019):
    - Late Majority are doing Microservices
    - Early Adopters are doing "Correctly built distributed systems".

Mindset shift that has to happen to actually support microservice architecture:

**Some parts of the system is always broken.** - That's an assumption you should always make.

Failure will happen. Accept it! But keep it local. Be resilient!

Fail fast is important, but not enough.

Distributed Systems introduce complexity you have to tackle!

During the talk there's a mention to BPMN: Business Process Model and Notation.
