## We're programmed to be poor

About "factory schools" and formal education:

> Much of this education, however was not technical in nature but social and moral. Workers who had always spent their working days in a domestic setting, had to be taught to follow orders, to respect the space and property rights of others, be punctual, docile, and sober.
>
> (...) The early industrial capitalists spent a great deal of effort and time in the social conditioning of their labor force, especially in sunday schools which were designed to inculcate middle class values and attitudes, so as to make the workers more susceptible to the incentives that the factory needed.

From Sorelle:

>  The system didn't want free thinkers or financially rich people. The education system wanted to program these people to do nothing more than doing their jobs in society.
> 
> That's why we're never taught to critically think, to provide value for society, to manage their finances. They're taught to follow orders and fit into a box.


One of the greatest and most rebelious ways in society is to be successful, in order to break through the expectations of who you're meant to be.
