# video - Vim as your editor

[ThePrimeagen youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R)

## Intro

### VimBeGood plugin

Install the VimBeGood plugin and play with it: <https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/vim-be-good>


### yank and delete buffer

> [!note]
> Delete and Yank send contents to the same buffer. 

I actually already new that, but said like that made more sense for me.


### relativenumber

- `:set relativenumber` -  enables relativenumber
- `:set norelativenumber` - disables it

> [!note]
> Most of the boolean options can be disabled with the prefix `no`
