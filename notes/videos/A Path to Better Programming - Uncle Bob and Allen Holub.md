- <https://youtu.be/QnmRpHFoYLk>

### If you were to write the book again, what would you change?

> I want to write about the things that don't change over time so that they are relevant for a very long time.
> -- Uncle Bob


### How to get devs to think from an architectural perspective?

> Some of the issues [of people not writing clean code] could be solve by thinking architecturaly rather than thinking just in terms of the code.
> -- Allen Holub


### Books

Book: Domain Driven Design

Problem: Programmers are not thinking architecturally at all!

> "Clean Code" is full of things that you learn the hard way after 15, 20, 25 years.
> -- Uncle Bob

Problem: We keep reinventing the wheel for no reason.

Book: Design Patterns - Gang of Four

> NONSENSE: "Design Patterns" are an old idea that's now out of date because our modern languages take advantage of that.
> -- Uncle Bob

Book: Structured Analysis and System Specification - Tom DeMarco

> In my experience, a programmer doesn't get into that level of thought process for the first 10, 15 years.
> -- Uncle Bob

### Ways to learn faster

> Mob programming helps shorten the learning cuve because of the collaboration.
> -- Allen Holub

Book: Turn the Ship Around!: a true story of turning followers into leaders - L. David Marquet 

> If it's a good idea, the good idea tends to spread, unless there's somebody at the management level working hard to make it not spread.
> -- Allen Holub




### Remote working

> Allen: People talk about productivity while at the same time doing everything they can to prevent it from happening
> Bob: Cause they don't understand where the productivity comes from.
