# The Quest for the Fastest Deployment Time - Ellen Korbes - Tilt


## 3 important rules

1. Don't rely on CI for development feedback
2. Use an Multiservice Development eXperience (MDX) tool like Tilt, Skaffold, Telepresence, or Garden.
3. Then use every hack, cheat and dirty trick in the book.


## What Tilt does?

- Watches code for changes
- Re-builds & re-deploys as needed
