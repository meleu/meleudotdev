Things I did/learned in June of 2022:

- Started playing with [BATS](https://github.com/meleu/bats-tutorial) while doing the challenges proposed by Blau Araujo [here](https://codeberg.org/blau_araujo/tecnicas-do-shell/issues/22)
- Started taking my Personal Knowledge Management system more seriously:
    - read [[Digital Zettelkasten - Principles, Methods, and Examples]]
    - started to spend more time curating my notes (instead of dumping more information on my note-taking system)
    - Started to be more aware of the Zettelkasten method via <https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/>
- Found a way to use my [[Google Drive on Linux]]
- Read [[Discurso sobre a servidao voluntaria]]
- Started to read [[Os 7 Habitos das pessoas Altamente Eficazes]]
