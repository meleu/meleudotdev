- Reading
    - Continuing with [[Os 7 Habitos das pessoas Altamente Eficazes]]
    - Started ‚≠ê [[Clean Code]], and it kinda made me want to rewrite every code I wrote üòÖ. Awesome book! The contents of the first 5 chapters should be taught in formal courses.

    - [[Fundamentals of TDD - upcase]]
    - [[Drawing - udemy]] - just to have fun with my younger son
    - finished [[OBS Studio - udemy]]
    - played a bit with [[learn-golang-with-tdd]], ‚≠ê **awesome content!**
- Created a video and posted on youtube
