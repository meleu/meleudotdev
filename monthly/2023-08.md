- Reading
    - [[Pragmatic Programmer]]
    - [[Effective Software Testing]]. I'm also converting the code to Ruby and sharing it in <https://github.com/meleu/effective-software-testing-ruby>
- Coding
    - Started practicing [[TailwindCSS]]
    - Decided to spend sometime with my [[vscodevim]] setup (I had some issues with [VSCode Neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) and decided to go back to emulation).
