## Working/Studying

- [[Terraform for the Absolute Beginners - udemy]]
- Installed [[NixOS|Nix]] on my Mac and investing time learning about it (so I can have reproducible dev environments)

## Reading

- [[Continuous Delivery]]

## Coding

- Dedicated some energy to learn [[lua]] (so I can follow neovim config videos actually understanding what I am doing).
- Back to practicing [[vim]] katas (I'm still creating them)
