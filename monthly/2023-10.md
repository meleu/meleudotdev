## Working/Studying

- [[k6 performance testing]]
- [[Terraform for the Absolute Beginners - udemy]]
- Installed [[NixOS|Nix]] on my Mac and invested some time learning about it (so I can have reproducible dev environments). But, damn!, it's not simple! I need to stop diving into this yak shaving! ðŸ˜–

## Reading

- [[Continuous Delivery]]
- [[Risiveis Amores]]

## Coding

- Dedicated some energy to learn [[lua]] (so I can follow neovim config videos actually understanding what I am doing).
- Back to practicing [[vim]] katas (I'm still creating them)
