    - (re)started reading [[Practical Object-Oriented Design]] (‚≠ê great book!)
    - Still reading [[Practical Vim]], and practicing what I've been learning.

    - Started to code a program to parse markdown files with vim exercises (highly inspired in [[Practical Vim]] and [Vim-Katas](https://github.com/adomokos/Vim-Katas)
    - Decided to spend sometime with my [[vscodevim]] setup (I had some issues with [VSCode Neovim](https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim) and decided to go back to emulation).
