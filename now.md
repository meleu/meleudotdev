# What I'm into *now*

Topics I'm currently diving into:

- [[TDD-Refactoring literature]]

## Frequent Ideas

- Managing complexity: the software's primary technical imperative. ([[Code Complete]])
- How to encourage co-workers to care about the quality of their work, despite business pressure? ([[Clean Coder]])
- How can I integrate TDD techniques in my workflow? Have it as a second nature. To achieve this I need to invest time in [[TDD-Refactoring literature]].


## Studying

- [ ] [[Effective Software Testing]]
- [ ] advanced usage of [[vim]]
