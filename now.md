# What I'm into *now*

Doing the Le Wagon bootcamp (from April to June/2023).

Topics I'm going to be immersed:

- [[Ruby]]
- [[sql]]
- HTML/CSS
- [[javascript]]
- Figma
- Rails


## Frequent Ideas

- Managing complexity: the software's primary technical imperative. ([[Code Complete]])
- How to encourage co-workers to care about the quality of their work, despite business pressure? ([[Clean Coder]])
- How can I integrate TDD techniques in my workflow? Have it as a second nature. To achieve this I need to invest time in [[TDD-Refactoring literature]].


## Studying

- [ ] Ruby (Le Wagon bootcamp)
- [x] [[Rust]]
- [ ] advanced usage of [[vim]]
- [ ] [[RSpec - udemy]]
- [ ] [[Fundamentals of TDD - upcase]]


## 2023 goals

- [ ] play with 12 programming languages - [[exercism - 12in23 challenge]]
