# Heuristics vs. Algorithms, or why questions are more important than the answers


Heristic is a way to think how to discover a solution rather than having a solution.

Somehow it makes me remember the book "Steal like an Artist". Study your idols and the idols of your idols. Pay more attention at the questions they were asking, and then the answers. Always keep in mind that the answers are based on the context, while questions are more likely to based on principles.

Context changes easier than principles.
