# Is programming for everyone?

In the PrimoTech Podcast I heard something interesting about the question "Is programming for everyone?". One of the participants said that it's a **social decision**.

In the past farmers, for example, could live their lives without reading and writing. And then, we, as a society, decided that read and write is an essential skill for every citizen. Even for those who are going to be writers. Nowadays no one is making questions like "is reading and writing for everyone?".

Currently we are witnessing a period of time where it's clear that having a minimal programming skill, or at least "computational thinking" is highly valuable. At some point we, as a society, will realize that we should learn basic programming skills.
