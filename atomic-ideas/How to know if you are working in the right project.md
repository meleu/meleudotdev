# How to know if you are working in the right project

As stated in [[Practical Object-Oriented Design]], programmers don't need to choose between pleasure and productivity. "The programming techniques that make code a joy to write overlap with those that most efficiently produce software".

I interpret this as a fundamental principle of my profession, and a corolary to this is: **if you're working on a project where writing code is not a joy, there's something wrong in the project and you must do something about it.** Possible things to do:

- See if the managers understand and encourage the importance of having high quality code. Do they understand that good code implies productivity?
- See if your team mates care about code quality (it can be overwhelming if you are the only one caring about improving the code quality).
- Observe if things are getting better or worse over time.
- finally, ask yourself if you really care about the project. Maybe you should simply look for another one.
