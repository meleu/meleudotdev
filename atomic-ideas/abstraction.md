# abstraction

> **Abstraction is the ability to engage with a concept while safely ignoring some of its details** â€” handling different details at different levels. Any time you work with an aggregate, you're working with an abstraction. If you refer to an object as a "house" rather than a combination of glass, wood, and nails, you're making an abstraction. If you refer to a collection of houses as a "town," you're making another abstraction.
