In this article I'm going to share things that are working quite well for me to learn the Ruby language.

The goal here is NOT to learn programming neither learn how to build web applications. I don't even talk about Rails here.

The goal here is solely and exclusively to acquire fluency in pure Ruby as quick as possible. Therefore, I'm assuming the reader already know some (any) programming language.

You probably know the typical advice: "practice a lot". That's a valid one, but too vague. In this article I'm just sharing what I used to practice a lot.


## TL;DR

- **Goal**: acquire basic fluency in pure Ruby as quick as possible
- Requisites
    - be comfortable with the command line interface
    - familiarity with programming
    - basics of OOP would help (but it's not mandatory)
    - find a reason to learn Ruby
- Aggressively ignore!
- Read [Ruby in 100 minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html) to get a good overview of the syntax
- do the challenges from the [Ruby track in exercism.org](https://exercism.org/tracks/ruby)
- Play with the [Ruby Koans](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans) to internalize some of the most fundamental concepts of language


## Requisites

Most of the things I'm showing here requires some commands on the terminal, so I'm assuming you're comfortable with the command line.

As I said, the intention here is not to learn programming (that would be too basic) neither learning how to create web applications (that would be too advanced). We just want to be fluent with Ruby as quick as possible.

Some knowledge about Object-Oriented Programming would make some things easier, but it's not mandatory. Just follow the examples and go with the flow.

Knowing the basics of `git` would help. Not exactly to learn, but to save your code and notes in a repository. But it's also NOT mandatory. Don't sweat over it if you don't know git.


### Why Ruby?

Before investing time on doing something, you need a good reason to do it!

I'm impressed about some great applications built with Ruby, like GitHub, GitLab, Airbnb, Shopify, Basecamp. I also read a lot of good things about the Ruby community and how they care about code quality, testing, well designed code, etc. But it never was enough to give me the motivation to go and try it.

My main reason to learn Ruby is because I'm going to a Web Development bootcamp, and their choice for the backend is Ruby on Rails. (why I chose such bootcamp is out of the scope of this article, maybe I write about it in the future)

During the process of learning Ruby I confirmed that it's indeed a pleasure to read and write Ruby code.

If you want to more info about how Ruby is cool, I'm sure you can find tons of good articles and videos if you google for it. Maybe you can start [here in the official "about" page of the language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/) and see a couple of videos. 

Please please please! Once you're convinced you want to learn Ruby, stop looking for more material! This leads us to the next topic...


## Aggressively Ignore

As I said, the Ruby community cares about quality. And for this reason there are tons of good material out there. So many that you would have an analysis paralysis trying to pick one from the list.

Right now I'm holding myself to not put here some awesome links. I'm doing this because it's a rabbit hole!

Yeah, it can be a little paradoxical. I'm telling you to ignore the existing Ruby tutorials out there not because they're bad, but because they're actually good! The problem is that there are tons of them. It's overwhelming!

Let's resist this urge to find The Best™️ resource to learn the language and focus on our goal: be fluent in Ruby **as quick as possible**!

To get fluent quickly you don't need to read a lot books/tutorials/articles, neither watch a lot of videos. You just need to get the basics of the syntax and then practice a lot.


## First contact with the language

If you start googling things like "how to get started with Ruby" you'll probably stumble upon the "Ruby in Twenty Minutes" in the official page. I didn't enjoy that, I found it kinda unstructured. Then I went for another material.

I really enjoyed this one: [Ruby in 100 minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html). Straight to the point and shows the basic syntax of the language. It worked very well for me. 

Be sure to read the article with your `irb` open and trying all those commands to see the magic happening.

I particularly enjoyed learning the concept of [Blocks](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#6.-blocks). Realizing that blocks are passed to methods clicked some things in my brain.

OK, now that we know the syntax, let's practice!


## Challenges from exercism.org

### Why exercism is so cool?

**There's a conceptual sequence to follow**



**The challenges use Test Driven Development (TDD)**


**You'll learn a lot look other people's solutions**


### tip: keep your solutions in a repository





## Ruby Koans - internalizing the fundamentals







## Things I wanna try later

This is a list of material that I'm planning to consume later, **after** acquiring the desired fluency.

I didn't yet went through them, but as they were suggested by experienced Rubyist, and I decided to share here.

- Practical Object-Oriented Design - book
- Confident Ruby - book 
- Metaprogramming Ruby 2 - 
- [Flawless Ruby](https://graceful.dev/courses/flawless-ruby/) - the course *after* the intro-to-Ruby course
