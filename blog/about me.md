## meleu in 15 seconds

I'm a Software Engineer and an [open source enthusiast](https://github.com/meleu).

Currently working as a DevOps Specialist but [migrating to Web Development](/from-devops-to-webdev).

A linux nerd since the late 90s, I live in the terminal and write about command line sorcery (in [Portuguese](https://meleu.sh/) and [English](https://meleu.hashnode.dev/tag/linux)).

Big retrograming fan. Between 2015-2021 I dedicated a big portion of my time to open source projects related to this hobby (mainly [RetroAchievements](https://retroachievements.org)).

I'm also an avid book reader.
