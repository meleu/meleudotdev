# Hi, I'm meleu! 👋

<div style="text-align: center">

I'm a **Software Engineer** from Brazil.

This is my 🌱 [[digital garden]]. Most of the contents is not "finished", but evolving over time.

> Other places you can find me:
> 
> - <https://meleu.sh> (in Portuguese)
> - [Github](https://github.com/meleu)
> - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meleu/)

I believe that **writing is thinking**, and the notes here exist to aid my thinking, learning and creating. I keep them public because [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) helps me to learn faster.

Here are some things that might be interesting to you:

- 🧑‍💻 info [[about]] me.
- 📰 [[articles]] I write about nerdy things (sometimes in [[artigos|portuguese]]).
- 🇧🇷🇵🇹 [[traducoes]] de artigos da área de TI que julgo que permanecerão relevantes por muitos anos.
- 📚 [[books]] I've been reading ([[books-tech|tech]], [[books-fiction|fiction]], or [[books-nonfiction|non-fiction]]).
- 🧰 [[uses|tools I use]] in my day-to-day life.
- ⌛ what I am (trying to) focus on [[now]].
- 📝 my [[monthly]] log

If you're curious enough to explore this garden, keep in mind that it can be a bilingual experience (English and Portuguese).
