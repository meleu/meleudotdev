# meleu.dev

## Hi, I'm meleu! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil (currently working in the DevOps field).

I love solving problems with code and meaningful human interactions.

This website is my 🌱 [[digital garden]], therefore most of the contents is not for other people's consumption. I believe that **writing is thinking**, and the notes here are written for myself to aid my thinking, learning and creating. I keep them public because I see [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) as a good practice.

There are some things that can be interesting though, for example:

- 🧑‍💻 information [[about]] me.
- 📰 some [[articles]] I write about nerdy things (sometimes in [[artigos|portuguese]]).
- 📚 which [[books]] I've been reading (tech, fiction, non-fiction, whatever gets my interest).
- ⌛ what I am focused on [[now]].
- 🧰 the tools I [[uses|use]] in my daily routine.
- 💭 other random thoughts...

If you're curious enough to explore this garden, keep in mind that it can be a bilingual experience.
