## Hi, I'm meleu! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a DevOps Engineer from Brazil.

I love solving problems with code. I also appreciate meaningful human interactions.

This website works like my [[digital garden]]. I believe that writing is thinking, so most of the notes here are written for myself to aid my thinking, learning and creating.

If you're curious enough to explore this garden, keep in mind that sometimes it's a bilingual experience (I prefer to write in English, but Portuguese is my native language).

In [[now]] page there's a list of things I'm currently focused on (hopefully).
