# meleu.dev

## Hi, I'm meleu! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil (currently working in the DevOps field).

I love 1) solving problems with code and 2) meaningful human interactions.

In this website you can have:

- 🧑‍💻 more information [[about]] me
- 📰 [[articles]] I write about nerdy things (sometimes in [[artigos|portuguese]]).
- 📚 which [[books]] I've been reading (tech, fiction, non-fiction, whatever gets my interest).
- ⌛ what I am focused on [[now]]

This website works like my 🌱 [[digital garden]]. I believe that writing is thinking, so most of the notes here are written for myself to aid my thinking, learning and creating (there are some "finished" [[articles]], though).

If you're curious enough to explore this garden, keep in mind that sometimes it's a bilingual experience (I prefer to write in 🇬🇧🇺🇸 English, but 🇧🇷🇵🇹 Portuguese is my native language).
