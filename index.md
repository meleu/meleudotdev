# meleu.dev

## Hi, I'm meleu! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil (currently working in the DevOps field).

I love 1) solving problems with code and 2) meaningful human interactions.

This website works as my 🌱 [[digital garden]]. Here you can see:

- 🧑‍💻 more information [[about]] me
- 📰 the [[articles]] I write about nerdy things (sometimes in [[artigos|portuguese]]).
- 📚 which [[books]] I've been reading (tech, fiction, non-fiction, whatever gets my interest).
- ⌛ what I am focused on [[now]]

I believe that writing is thinking, and the notes here are written for myself to aid my thinking, learning and creating. I keep them public because I like to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)

The notes I believe that can be useful to others, I list [[articles|here (English)]] and [[artigos|here (Portuguese)]]. Sometimes I also like to [[traducoes|translate valuable/timeless articles to portuguese]].

If you're curious enough to explore this garden, keep in mind that it can be a bilingual experience.
